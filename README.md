# Advanced NLP Pipeline

## Objective

The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline capable of performing a wide range of tasks, including sentiment analysis, topic modeling, text summarization, and relation extraction. The pipeline leverages state-of-the-art models and techniques to process and analyze textual data effectively.

## How It Works

The NLP pipeline integrates several advanced NLP tasks:

- **Advanced Sentiment Analysis**: Utilizes transformer-based models from Hugging Face's Transformers library to perform sentiment analysis.
- **Topic Modeling**: Employs LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to identify prominent topics within the text.
- **Text Summarization**: Implements summarization techniques to generate concise summaries of the text.
- **Relation Extraction**: Provides a framework for extracting semantic relationships between entities (currently as a placeholder for integration with a trained model).

The pipeline is built using Python and leverages popular libraries like spaCy for text processing and Transformers for leveraging state-of-the-art models.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- spaCy
- Gensim
- Sumy
- Hugging Face's Transformers library

Make sure you have the required Python version and libraries installed to use the pipeline.

## Installation

First, install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install spacy gensim sumy transformers
```

Additionally, you may need to download specific models or data required by these libraries:

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_trf
```

## Usage

To use the NLP pipeline, import and initialize the `AdvancedNLPPipeline` class with your text, and then call the `summarize` method to process the text through various NLP tasks:

```python
from your_pipeline_module import AdvancedNLPPipeline

text = "Your input text here."
pipeline = AdvancedNLPPipeline(text)
summary = pipeline.summarize()

for key, value in summary.items():
    print(f"{key.capitalize()}: {value}\n")
```

## Example Output

```
Sentiment_analysis: [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9998}]

Topic_modeling: {'Topic 1': ['tesla', 'energy', 'electric'], 'Topic 2': ['solar', 'products', 'services'], ...}

Text_summarization: "Tesla Inc. is an American electric vehicle and clean energy company. Tesla's products include electric cars and battery energy storage."

Relation_extraction: [('Tesla', 'based', 'California'), ('Tesla', 'include', 'cars')]
```

## Notes

- The **Relation Extraction** task is implemented as a placeholder. It's intended to be replaced with a specific relation extraction model suited to your requirements.
- The performance and capabilities of the pipeline can vary significantly based on the input text and the specific models used for each task.
